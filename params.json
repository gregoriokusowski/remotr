It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"### Overview\r\n\r\nRunning in Ruby, using Sinatra and AppleScript, remotr is a simple application that aims for simplicity on presentations.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* Keynote\r\n* Ruby ( bundler is recommended but not needed )\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nIn order to get the app running, you can setup it by executing the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/gregoriokusowski/remotr.git\r\n$ cd remotr/ && bundle\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Just in case you don't have bundler, or don't want to use it, it's possible to install sinatra manually with ```gem install sinatra```.\r\n\r\n### Up and Running\r\n\r\nIf you are ready with the setup steps, feel free to run the following on the remotr folder:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ruby remotr.rb\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will start a sinatra server on your machine, on port 4567.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nFirst of all, your Keynote presentation, should be opened at Play mode. ( This part can be improved )\r\nLet's say that your machine's IP address is 192.168.1.5.\r\nSo everything you should do now, is access ```http://192.168.1.5:4567/show/next``` to advance, ```http://192.168.1.5:4567/show/previous``` to go back and to get the notes from the current page ```http://192.168.1.5:4567/notes/current``` .\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is the option to access ```http://192.168.1.5:4567/``` and use it to navigate with an UI instead of just access the URLs by hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\n\r\n* Release as a gem.\r\n* Open Keynote and Play the Presentation\r\n* Create a command line interface, working with features like:\r\n  * Presentation to open and show # like ``` $ remotr foo.key ```\r\n  * Port # like ``` $ remotr --port 1233 ```\r\n  * Password # maybe prompt it :)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nremotr is released under The MIT License (MIT).\r\n"}
