### Overview

Running in Ruby, using Sinatra and AppleScript, remotr is a simple application that aims for simplicity on presentations.

### Prerequisites

* Keynote
* Ruby ( bundler is recommended but not needed )

### Setup

In order to get the app running, you can setup it by executing the following commands:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/gregoriokusowski/remotr.git
$ cd remotr/ && bundle
```

Note: Just in case you don't have bundler, or don't want to use it, it's possible to install sinatra manually with ```gem install sinatra```.

### Up and Running

If you are ready with the setup steps, feel free to run the following on the remotr folder:

```
$ ruby remotr.rb
```

This will start a sinatra server on your machine, on port 4567.

### Usage

First of all, your Keynote presentation, should be opened at Play mode. ( This part can be improved )
Let's say that your machine's IP address is 192.168.1.5.
So everything you should do now, is access ```http://192.168.1.5:4567/show/next``` to advance, ```http://192.168.1.5:4567/show/previous``` to go back and to get the notes from the current page ```http://192.168.1.5:4567/notes/current``` .


There is the option to access ```http://192.168.1.5:4567/``` and use it to navigate with an UI instead of just access the URLs by hand.


### Todo

* Release as a gem.
* Open Keynote and Play the Presentation
* Create a command line interface, working with features like:
  * Presentation to open and show # like ``` $ remotr foo.key ```
  * Port # like ``` $ remotr --port 1233 ```
  * Password # maybe prompt it :)
